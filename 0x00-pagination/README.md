Pagination, also known as paging, is the process of dividing a document into discrete pages, either electronic pages or printed pages.

In reference to books produced without a computer, pagination can mean the consecutive page numbering to indicate the proper order of the pages

JSON pagination is used when the number of elements returned in the server's JSON response is too large. The server can limit the number of items in the JSON to a small subset ("page") of the total available set to reduce the amount of data transferred from the server and speed up the server response time. The server will then provide links to get the previous and next JSON pages from the dataset. In this Python JSON pagination example, we limit the number of items in JSON to 5 and provide links to the previous and next JSON pages in the links JSON object.
